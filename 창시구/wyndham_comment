He was extremely upset at how I was hung up on by one agent and then berated by a ""SUPERVISOR"". Her behavior makes me NEVER want to do business with the RAMADA or ANY WYNDHAM property.\n\nI spoke with FIVE people today. 3 were unable to help me, the 4th hung up on me because I asked why she is saying she needed to verify my phone number when I\'ve never even given it so she hung up.\n\nBack to Jenna, I want to file an official complaint and I will continue to write complaints on her until something is done.\n\nI am furious with the way I was treated by your stuff, ESPECIALLY a SUPERVISOR in customer care.

138,"['Thank you for sharing üôåüèº‚ò∫Ô∏è', 'HOWARD JOHNSON BY WYNDHAM, FULLERTON LOCATION: The ultimate worst experience anyone can have as a customer!!!!!!!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, HORRID HOTEL MAINTENANCE AND ROACHES. When we arrived Thursday night we checked in and dropped off our belongings. We were in the room for less then 10 minutes, it had a really bad odor so I mentioned to front desk before leaving for Disney and they said they would send someone to deodorize the room. We come back later that night around 2AM, our keys weren‚Äôt working so Daniel the man working sent some third party security guard to try using several keys to open the door and nothing seemed to work. I don‚Äôt think professional is in this hotels vocabulary because No manager was available at the time or anytime, so there only solution was to put us in a different room without our stuff until 7AM when the maintenance guy would be available.', 'I argued that we needed our stuff and how inconvenient this was, the guy acted like it was normal and didn‚Äôt put any effort into making us feel like we would be taken care of. They had us waiting in the lobby while his manager walked him through steps to get door open, instead of Putting us in a room first  he had us waiting at almost 3AM. The manager should have shown on the spot. Too top it off, my daughter was with us and they had her eating outside in there hallway while we waited for them to fix the door before lobby. We were forced to sleep in another room with none of our stuff. On our way to the other room 3 cockroaches run passed me. That was the cherry on top of the lack of customer service and professionalism. I get a call in the morning by Mariel, who says we can return to the room with our belongings. Now, I‚Äôm thinking your trying to put me back in the same room I got locked out of, how is that even an option. I ask Mariel for a refund of our stay and she stated we would have to wait until 11AM for manager to arrive, now what I don‚Äôt understand is why is the customer Waiting for people to do there jobs correctly. She also didn‚Äôt make us feel comfortable or taken care of. We have already planned on leaving the minute we get our stuff but the simple fact was they expected us to stay in that room again, which still had a really bad odor. After several attempts of complaining to corporate, which also lacked the customer service, stated they can‚Äôt authorize anything but a complaint that would give the hotel a week to resolve not now but a week. I go back at 11AM expecting to speak with a manager, nope! The manager was in a ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù. Never got a call or spoke with any management in person. NO MANAGER OR EMPLOYEE EVER APOLOGIZED. We did get our cash refund and I was relieved that nightmare was over.', 'BUT NO, I get an email from them stating they charged my card 178.64, and it will be refunded to card on file. I was confused cause my room was paid with cash for $256.08, which was refunded. I never enforced why I was charged the extra 178.64 with NO CONSENT, because I don‚Äôt wanna deal with the lack of knowledge that the people have at this hotel. Or waste anymore time and energy from my vacation time on them. All I know is the refund better be valid. Otherwise don‚Äôt even waste your time or money with rude and dirty environment. Definitely not kid friendly or friendly at all!!!!!!!! WORST PLACE EVER!!!!!', 'Went to a time share presentation in Las Vegas on 5/23. We were lied to repeatedly about the discovery package, we were lied to about the perks telling us we could get money off our Verizon and directv bill, both blatant lies, the perks are a joke. We were told we could book Wyndham affiliated hotels and motels with our points, blatant lie as we can only use ""rewards points"". We were NOT told that there is a 3 night minimum for booking resorts. We were NOT told that everything books up 10 months ahead of time and we must book our vacations 10 months ahead of time. We were told it would be $91 dollars a month, another LIE because that didn\'t include the stack of interest charges making it over $20 a month more. We were told we would be contacted by someone to set up our account online and after 5 days of not being contacted we decided to look into it ourselves, when we discovered all these lies we wanted out. When we looked into a refund turns out you must cancel within 5 days, and the 6th day wasn\'t good enough. IF YOU GO TO A TIMESHARE PRESENTATION JUST SAY NO NO NO. I could see through the sales pitch like glass, but the blantant disgusting LIES we were told is something I was not aware of at the time. And now we are stuck with this B.S. package we have no interest in because it isn\'t even remotely close to what we were led to believe. Avoid Wyndham at all costs for not only the salesman lying but for also denying our request to get a refund despite us illustrating the lies.']","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[241966435, 31168739, 31168739, 31168739, 210443333]","[[], [], [], [], []]"

Makes no sense because literally no other additional information was required. Some way to treat a loyal member... seems more like a ploy to generate more business at the expense of their members.
